Minimal Transport Layer Protocols (UDP/TCP) over IP using TUN/TAP Interfaces

This project implements minimal clients for transport-layer protocols (UDP and TCP) over IP, making use of the TUN/TAP interfaces. By configuring virtual network interfaces (tun0), the client application can send and receive network packets through these devices, simulating network communication at the IP level.

 The project currently includes:

* A wrapper for IP packet construction.
* A UDP client capable of sending and receiving UDP datagrams.
* A small DNS frame wrapper to handle DNS queries over UDP.
* Work-in-progress implementation of TCP over IP.

The project demonstrates how raw packet manipulation can be achieved using the TUN/TAP interfaces, providing insights into low-level network protocol handling without relying on the OS network stack.
